        "Clear this server's buffered Unity console logs. Use it to discard stale entries - e.g. a one-off compile error from a failed execute_editor_command snippet - so a later get_logs isn't ambiguous about whether an error is current. Only clears the server-side buffer; Unity keeps broadcasting, so new logs accumulate from this point on. Note that execute_editor_command already returns a per-call 'errors' array scoped to just that command, which is the most reliable signal for whether a specific snippet failed.",
